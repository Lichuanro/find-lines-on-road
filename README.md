# Find Lines on Road  

this project's framework is based on Udacity's self-driving car engineer nano degree [Part1](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1)    
In this project I try to detect and locate the lines on the roads   
  **Canny edge detection**   
  **Hough transform**   are the main methods     
          
  _camera calibration_    
  _color space to HSV or HSL_    
  _Sober operator_
  could also be implemented to get more accuracy
